## **2. Core Design Pillars**

1. **Satirical Depth Through Asymmetry:** Each faction is a sharp commentary on modern power structures. Their mechanics parody how these institutions operate, allowing humor to emerge naturally from gameplay.
2. **Accessible Complexity:** Simple, universal actions become strategically deep through faction-specific abilities and interactions. A new player can understand the basics immediately, but mastery requires a deep understanding of asymmetric interactions.
3. **The World is a Stage:** The game is a simulation of the battle for relevance in a chaotic, 24/7 news cycle. The most powerful weapon is the ability to control the narrative.
4. **Edge-First Performance:** The game is built from the ground up to be fast and responsive, with a focus on low-latency interactions and quick cold starts.
5. **Single Developer Maintainability:** All systems are designed to be understandable, debuggable, and editable by one person.
