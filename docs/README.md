## **üéÆ Quick Overview**

**Satire Empire** is a turn-based multiplayer strategy game where players embody outlandish modern factions (rogue AI, influencer cults, hyper-capitalist corporations) to compete for global influence. The game features:

- **Asymmetric Gameplay:** Each faction has unique abilities that parody real-world institutions
- **Fast-Paced Matches:** 10-20 minute games for 2-8 players
- **Modern Web Platform:** PWA with responsive design for desktop and mobile
- **Neobrutalist Aesthetics:** Bold, satirical visual design
- **Edge-First Performance:** Built on Cloudflare's global network for low latency

## **üèóÔ∏è Technical Stack**

- **Frontend:** TypeScript with Neobrutalism Components
- **Backend:** Cloudflare Workers with ES modules and Partykit
- **Database:** Cloudflare D1 and Durable Objects
- **Map Engine:** Maplibre GL JS
- **Deployment:** Cloudflare Pages with global CDN
- **PWA:** Service Worker for offline-first experience

## **üéØ Development Status**

The project is currently in **planning phase**. The development roadmap outlines a phased approach to launch with three major milestones:

1. **MVP:** Basic multiplayer functionality
2. **Core Game:** Complete faction system and mechanics
3. **Enhanced Experience:** Production-ready launch

## **üìã Getting Started**

## **üìù Contributing**

This documentation is living and should be updated as the project evolves. Key areas for contribution:

- **Technical Implementation:** Update specs as architecture decisions are made
- **Design System:** Document new components and patterns
- **Game Balance:** Track faction mechanics and balance changes
- **User Feedback:** Integrate insights from playtesting and user research

## **üé® Design Philosophy**

The game follows five core design pillars:

1. **Satirical Depth Through Asymmetry** - Each faction parodies real-world institutions
2. **Accessible Complexity** - Simple actions with deep strategic interactions
3. **The World is a Stage** - Narrative control as the ultimate weapon
4. **Edge-First Performance** - Built for speed and responsiveness
5. **Single Developer Maintainability** - Clean, understandable codebase
