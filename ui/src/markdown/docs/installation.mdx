## 1. Initialize shadcn

As explained in introduction, most of these components are based on <a target="_blank" href="https://ui.shadcn.com/">Shadcn UI</a>. 

Visit <a href='https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli#init' target='_blank'>shadcn docs</a> to see how to initialize shadcn.

<Warning className="mt-8 mb-4" description="Neobrutalism components doesn't support utility class components anymore, only css variables components. Also, it doesn't matter which baseColor you choose, because it doesn't change the styling." />

## 2. Add styling

Delete the existing styling from your `globals.css` and paste <Link target='_blank' href='/styling'>desired styling</Link>.

## 3. Install components

### Install via Shadcn cli

Just choose desired component variant and desired package manager, copy cli command to your terminal and you're good to go. 
If there is no shadcn cli command on the component page you'll have to install the component manually.

### Install manually

In this docs below each component's name you'll have the shadcn docs link for that component.

e.g. You want to install shadcn button component. You'll navigate to <a target='_blank' href='/components/button'>button page</a>, click on the shadcn docs
link and install the button component like it's shown in the docs.

After you're done you'll come back to neobrutalism button page, and copy button component to your project inside `components/ui/button.tsx``
(this is the default component path) or your custom component path.

Keep in mind that neobrutalism components can have different variants than default shadcn components.

### Other components

If the shadcn docs link is not present on the component's page, just copy the component and read the instructions if there are any.
