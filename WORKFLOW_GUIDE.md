# Satire Empire - Development Workflow Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ How to Keep AI Development On Track

This guide ensures you get consistent, high-quality development following the **Context Engineering** approach built into this project.

## ðŸ§  Context Engineering Workflow

### **1. Always Start with Context**

Before any development task, ensure the AI reads the relevant documentation:

```
@.cursorrules @docs/vision.md @docs/technical.md @docs/gameplay.md @roadmap.md
```

**Key Files to Reference:**
- `.cursorrules` - Development rules and patterns
- `docs/vision.md` - Game vision and design pillars  
- `docs/technical.md` - Architecture and implementation details
- `docs/gameplay.md` - Game mechanics and balance
- `ROADMAP.md` - Current phase and priorities
- `examples/` - Working code patterns

### **2. Leverage Specialized Agents**

Use agents from `agents/categories/` for domain expertise:

- **`@backend-developer.md`** - Server logic and APIs
- **`@frontend-developer.md`** - UI components and client code
- **`@game-developer.md`** - Game mechanics and optimization
- **`@typescript-pro.md`** - Type safety and architecture
- **`@qa-expert.md`** - Testing strategies
- **`@performance-engineer.md`** - Optimization

**Usage Pattern:**
```
I need to implement the Rogue AI faction. 
@game-developer.md @backend-developer.md @typescript-pro.md
Context: @docs/gameplay.md @examples/game-engine-example.ts
```

### **3. Follow PRP Methodology**

Use the **Product Requirements Prompts** from `template/PRPs/`:

1. **Problem Definition** - What exactly needs to be built?
2. **Requirements** - Technical and functional specifications  
3. **Patterns** - Code examples and architectural guidance

## ðŸ”„ Full Development Cycle

### **Phase 1: Planning & Context**

```bash
# 1. Start with documentation context
"I want to implement [feature]. Let me provide context:"
@.cursorrules @docs/technical.md @relevant-agent.md

# 2. Define requirements clearly
"Requirements:
- Feature: [specific functionality]
- Technical: [implementation details]
- Dependencies: [what relies on this]
- Tests: [what needs testing]"
```

### **Phase 2: Implementation**

```bash
# 3. Implement with todo tracking
"Create todos for this multi-step feature"
# AI will use todo_write tool to track progress

# 4. Write code following patterns
# AI follows .cursorrules:
# - TypeScript strict mode
# - ES modules
# - Modular architecture (<500 lines per file)
# - Test-first development

# 5. Validate as you go
"Check for linting errors and fix them"
# AI will use read_lints tool
```

### **Phase 3: Testing & Quality**

```bash
# 6. Comprehensive testing
"Create unit tests for this feature using Vitest"
"Add E2E tests for the user flow with Playwright"
"Test accessibility compliance"

# 7. Performance validation
"Check Core Web Vitals and bundle size impact"
```

### **Phase 4: Git Workflow**

```bash
# 8. Clean commits following conventions
git add .
git commit -m "feat(faction): implement Rogue AI with automation abilities

- Add RogueAI class extending BaseFaction
- Implement unique abilities: cyber-hack, automate, neural-network  
- Add automation mechanics for resource generation
- Create comprehensive test suite
- Update faction selection UI
- Performance: maintained <100ms action processing

Closes #123"

# 9. Push and update documentation
git push origin feature/rogue-ai-faction
```

## âš¡ Key Workflow Principles

### **Context Engineering Commands**

Always use these patterns to maintain context:

```bash
# Feature Development
"@.cursorrules @technical.md @gameplay.md 
Implement [feature] following the established patterns."

# Bug Fixing  
"@.cursorrules @examples/[relevant-example].ts
Fix this bug while maintaining type safety and performance."

# Code Review
"@.cursorrules @typescript-pro.md 
Review this code for architecture and TypeScript best practices."

# Testing
"@.cursorrules @qa-expert.md
Create comprehensive tests for this game mechanic."
```

### **Git Commit Standards**

Follow **Conventional Commits** with game-specific prefixes:

```bash
feat(engine): add turn-based phase management
fix(faction): resolve Influencer Cult viral spreading bug
docs(api): update multiplayer WebSocket documentation  
test(ui): add E2E tests for territory selection
perf(map): optimize Maplibre GL rendering performance
refactor(types): consolidate shared interfaces
chore(deps): update Cloudflare Workers runtime
```

### **Test Validation Checklist**

For every feature:

- [ ] **Unit Tests** - Logic and edge cases (Vitest)
- [ ] **Integration Tests** - API endpoints and data flow  
- [ ] **E2E Tests** - Critical user journeys (Playwright)
- [ ] **Type Safety** - No TypeScript errors or warnings
- [ ] **Performance** - Bundle size and Core Web Vitals
- [ ] **Accessibility** - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- [ ] **Game Balance** - Faction balance and victory conditions

## ðŸŽ® Game-Specific Workflow

### **Adding New Features**

```bash
# 1. Context and Planning
"@.cursorrules @gameplay.md @technical.md
I want to add [game feature]. What's the implementation approach?"

# 2. Check Game Balance
"@game-developer.md How does this affect faction balance?"

# 3. Implementation
"Implement this following the game engine patterns in examples/"

# 4. Testing
