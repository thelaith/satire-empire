# Satire Empire

A satirical, turn-based multiplayer strategy game where players embody outlandish modern factions to compete for global influence. Built for the modern web with a unique Neobrutalist aesthetic.

## 🎮 Game Overview

**Satire Empire** is a web-first multiplayer strategy game where players take on the role of absurd modern factions (rogue AI, influencer cults, hyper-capitalist corporations) competing for global dominance. Each turn represents a day in the global news cycle, where players compete to make headlines and shape the narrative.

### **Core Features**
- **Asymmetric Gameplay**: Each faction has unique abilities that parody real-world institutions
- **Fast-Paced Matches**: 10-20 minute games for 2-8 players
- **Modern Web Platform**: PWA with responsive design for desktop and mobile
- **Neobrutalist Aesthetics**: Bold, satirical visual design
- **Edge-First Performance**: Built on Cloudflare's global network for low latency

## 🎯 Game Design

### **Core Gameplay Loop: "The News Cycle"**
Each turn represents a single day in the global news cycle:
1. **Morning Brief (45s)**: World events and resource generation
2. **Action Phase (90-120s)**: Players queue actions simultaneously
3. **Breaking News Resolution (45s)**: Actions resolve with dramatic presentation

### **Victory Conditions**
- **Territorial Domination**: Control a majority of the world's regions
- **Economic Empire**: Accumulate target wealth
- **Cultural Hegemony**: Convert majority of regions to your influence
- **Innovation Leader**: Achieve key technological breakthroughs
- **Attention Monopoly**: Maintain #1 trending topic for set turns

### **Factions**
Each faction is asymmetric with unique abilities:
- **The Influencer Cult**: Viral marketing and social manipulation
- **The Rogue AI**: Technological disruption and automation
- **The Hyper-Capitalist Corporation**: Economic warfare and market control
- *More factions in development...*

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The game follows five core design pillars:

1. **Satirical Depth Through Asymmetry** - Each faction parodies real-world institutions
2. **Accessible Complexity** - Simple actions with deep strategic interactions
3. **The World is a Stage** - Narrative control as the ultimate weapon
4. **Edge-First Performance** - Built for speed and responsiveness
5. **Single Developer Maintainability** - Clean, understandable codebase
