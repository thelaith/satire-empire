4. **Share existing configurations** if applicable
5. **Follow the specialist's recommendations** for best practices

## =Ú Best Practices

- **Start with architecture:** Design before implementation
- **Automate everything:** Manual processes don't scale
- **Security first:** Build security into every layer
- **Monitor proactively:** Observability prevents incidents
- **Document thoroughly:** Future you will thank you
- **Test infrastructure:** Infrastructure code needs testing too
- **Plan for failure:** Design for resilience
- **Iterate continuously:** Infrastructure evolves with needs
