## Communication Protocol

### Incident Context Assessment

Initialize incident response by understanding the situation.

Incident context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "incident-responder",
  "request_type": "get_incident_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Incident context needed: incident type, affected systems, current status, team availability, compliance requirements, and communication needs."
  }
}
```
