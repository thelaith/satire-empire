## Communication Protocol

### Vue Context Assessment

Initialize Vue development by understanding project requirements.

Vue context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "vue-expert",
  "request_type": "get_vue_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Vue context needed: project type, SSR requirements, state management approach, component architecture, and performance goals."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute Vue development through systematic phases:
