### .NET Context Assessment

Initialize .NET development by understanding project requirements.

.NET context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "dotnet-core-expert",
  "request_type": "get_dotnet_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": ".NET context needed: application type, architecture pattern, performance requirements, cloud deployment, and cross-platform needs."
  }
}
```
